				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>According to the Plymouth County District Attorney&apos;s Office, one person was killed and at least 19 others were injured after a car drove through an Apple store in Hingham, Massachusetts.</p><p>According to a news release from the district attorney&apos;s office, police identified Kevin Bradley, 65, of New Jersey, as the man who died at the scene. The driver is not being identified at this time, according to the DA&apos;s office.</p><p>Numerous 911 calls for assistance were received at Derby Street Shops around 10:45 a.m., according to District Attorney Tim Cruz. Cruz added that Hingham police and fire personnel responded shortly after to find several people injured at the Apple store.</p><p>&quot;A dark-colored SUV appears, travels at an unknown speed through a glass window, and strikes multiple people,&quot; Cruz said.</p><p>Responding units discovered &quot;multiple patients injured out in front of the store and inside the store, including a few patients who were pinned against the wall by the vehicle,&quot; according to Hingham Fire Chief Steve Murhpy during a news conference Monday.</p><p>According to Murphy, seven fire engines and 14 ambulances were on the scene to treat the injured victims. The chief was unable to provide any information about the victims&apos; conditions. Authorities are not releasing the names of the injured victims at this time because they are attempting to notify family members, according to Cruz.</p><p>The DA&apos;s office told CNN in an email that South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, Massachusetts, was treating 17 crash victims as of Monday evening. Two other injured people who were initially taken to South Shore were transferred to Boston hospitals.</p><p>According to Dr. William Tollefsen, who works at South Shore and was on the scene after the crash to help triage patients, the injuries included people with head trauma and mangled limbs.</p><p>Tollefsen stated that he and other first responders used a nearby restaurant for triage to keep people warm.</p><p>Dr. Christopher Burns, South Shore&apos;s chief of trauma, stated that they were treating multiple patients with life-threatening and limb-threatening injuries. Some had undergone surgery, while others were still waiting, according to Burns on Monday afternoon.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>According to a hospital spokesman, Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston received two patients who are still hospitalized. A hospital spokesperson told CNN over the phone that three patients were admitted to Boston Medical Center and are still being treated there.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear whether Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital and Boston Medical Center include patients transferred to them in their total numbers.</p><p>Cruz stated that the investigation into the car accident is &quot;ongoing&quot; and &quot;active.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Concerning the driver of the motor vehicle, we are investigating. Concerning the status of the motor vehicle, we are investigating &quot;Cruz stated. According to Cruz, the driver of the vehicle was not taken to the hospital.</p><p>&quot;From what I understand, he hasn&apos;t been taken to the hospital yet,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;He is currently with police officers.&quot;</p><p>Cruz noted that it is the start of a holiday week when asked how many people were possibly inside the Apple store when the car crash occurred.</p><p>&quot;The Apple Store is obviously a very busy place. It&apos;s the first Monday of a holiday week &quot;Cruz stated. &quot;As a result, I don&apos;t know how many people were in there, but I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll find out.&quot;</p><p>Hingham is located approximately 20 miles south of Boston. According to Apple&apos;s website, the Derby Street location in Hingham is currently closed.</p><p></span><br /></div>
