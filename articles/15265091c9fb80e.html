				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>A car crashed into an Apple Store at the Derby Street Shops in Hingham, Massachusetts, on Monday morning, killing one and injuring 17, according to the Plymouth County District Attorney&apos;s office.</p><p>A dark-colored SUV crashed through the plate glass window around 10:45 a.m., striking multiple people, including several who were pinned against a wall, according to officials.</p><p>District Attorney Tim Cruz confirmed one man was killed, calling it an &quot;unthinkable morning.&quot; Kevin Bradley, 65, of New Jersey, has been identified.</p><p>Sixteen people were taken to the hospital, 14 to South Shore Hospital and two to Boston hospitals, according to Cruz. South Shore Hospital reported receiving 17 patients, one of whom walked in after the crash.</p><p>Dr. Christopher Burns, the hospital&apos;s trauma director, stated that there were numerous patients with life-threatening or limb-threatening injuries, with several currently undergoing surgery.</p><p>A medical helicopter was initially dispatched but was later canceled. Several ambulances were seen transporting injured people to medical care. According to fire officials, bystanders and off-duty hospital employees were among those who jumped in to help provide emergency care in the immediate aftermath of the crash.</p><p>Around 3:30 p.m., the SUV was removed from the store. The driver, who has not been identified publicly, is being held by police and has not yet been taken to the hospital. An active criminal investigation is underway, and authorities did not immediately provide additional information on the driver.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll find out once we&apos;ve had a chance to review all of the documents and tapes, wherever they&apos;re needed to go forward from there and figure out exactly what happened and what the absolutely unthinkable event that occurred at that store when you&apos;re just going there to buy a phone or get something fixed or whatever it may be. It&apos;s completely tragic &quot;Cruz stated.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Investigators appear to be using a neighboring restaurant as a staging area and have erected a white tent in front of the store. A mobile command center was brought in around 1 p.m., according to an NBC10 Boston crew on the scene.</p><p>&quot;Needless to say, employees in that store and nearby are visibly shaken, and they&apos;re assembling nearby,&quot; Cruz explained.</p><p>Aerial footage depicts a massive emergency response. At the front of the store, a large hole can be seen in the glass.</p><p>Apple issued the following statement on Monday afternoon:</p><p>&quot;We are devastated by today&apos;s shocking events at Apple Derby Street, as well as the tragic loss of a professional who was onsite supporting recent store construction. Our hearts go out to our injured team members and customers, as well as everyone else affected by this terrible incident. We are doing everything possible to assist our team members and customers during this difficult time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We suddenly hear a bang, a very loud bang. I don&apos;t want to say explosion. So we jumped up from our seats, looked out the window, and saw the hole in the Apple Store. And she&apos;d seen a car pass by and thought, &apos;Oh my god, that car just went through the Apple Store.&apos; And that was the end of it. This is simply excessive. I just want to get back home. &quot;It was a lot,&quot; one witness, identified as &quot;Ann, said &quot;according to NBC10 Boston</p><p></span><br /></div>
