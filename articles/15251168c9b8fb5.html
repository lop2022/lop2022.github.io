				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>CBS News confirmed the authenticity of data from Hunter Biden&apos;s former laptop on Monday, more than two years after The Washington Post first revealed its contents, after the first son&apos;s lawyer complained that he didn&apos;t &quot;consent&quot; to the release.</p><p>The laptop connects President Biden to his son Hunter and brother Jim Biden&apos;s foreign influence-peddling, but high-ranking former spy agency officials claimed it was likely Russian disinformation before the 2020 election, and the story was censored by Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>Until recently, most news outlets ignored the contents of the laptop. CBS&apos;s report comes after the Washington Post and New York Times confirmed the laptop late in March.</p><p>Former Delaware computer repairman John PaulMac Isaac gave CBS correspondent Catherine Herridge a copy of Hunter Biden&apos;s hard drive, and Minnesota computer scientists led by former Secret Service computer crimes expert Mark Lanterman said the files appeared legitimate.</p><p>Lanterman&apos;s firm determined that the contents of the laptop accumulated over time, as expected, and that there was no evidence that the documents were altered by outsiders.</p><p>Herridge did not specify which documents from the laptop were found to be genuine. She did, however, say that two sources confirmed that Joe Biden was the &quot;big guy&quot; in an infamous May 2017 email that described a 10% side-aside as part of a deal with a Chinese government-linked company.</p><p>&quot;Two of Hunter Biden&apos;s former business partners, including Tony Bobulinski, who received the email, told CBS News that the 10% held by H for the big guy&apos; was shorthand for Hunter&apos;s father&apos;s 10%,&quot; Herridge reported. &quot;The email&apos;s author, James Gilliar, has not responded to CBS News&apos; questions.&quot;</p><p>Hunter Biden, according to Mac Isaac, brought the laptop to his Delaware shop but never picked it up. He claims that the FBI took the original laptop in December 2019 after he informed them of its contents. He gave The Post files from the device in October 2020.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;At no time, including Mr. Mac Isaac, did any individual have Mr. Biden&apos;s consent to access or share his computer data with others,&quot; Hunter Biden&apos;s attorney, Chris Clark, complained to CBS.</p><p>Clark also stated, without elaborating, that &quot;there have been numerous attempts to hack, infect, distort, and peddle misinformation regarding Mr. Biden&apos;s devices and data.&quot;</p><p>Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the incoming Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Thursday that he will help lead GOP efforts to learn more about Joe Biden&apos;s ties to his family&apos;s business ventures.</p><p>&quot;This committee will determine whether or not this president is compromised or influenced by foreign dollars. This is a Joe Biden investigation &quot;Comer stated.</p><p>The first document obtained by The Washington Post from Hunter Biden&apos;s laptop described then-Vice President Joe Biden&apos;s attendance at a 2015 dinner at DC&apos;s Cafe Milanoto, to which his son invited a slew of associates, including a representative of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, which paid Hunter Biden up to $1 million per year while his father oversaw Obama&apos;s Ukraine policy.</p><p>Documents on the laptop are displayed Hunter Biden also invited three Kazakhstani businessmen, as well as Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov, to the dinner.</p><p></span><br /></div>
