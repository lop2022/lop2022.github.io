				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>According to an independent review commissioned by CBS News, data from a laptop that the lawyer for a Delaware computer repair shop owner claims was left by Hunter Biden in 2019 and that the shop owner later provided to the FBI under subpoena shows no evidence of tampering or fabrication.</p><p>The shop owner&apos;s lawyer, Brian Della Rocca, provided CBS News with an &quot;exact copy&quot; of the laptop data provided to federal investigators nearly three years ago. Della Rocca believes it is &quot;clean&quot; because it predates versions widely circulated by Republican operatives in order to attack then-candidate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Two cyber investigators from Minneapolis-based Computer Forensics Services conducted an independent investigation and found no evidence that the user data had been modified, fabricated, or tampered with. It also found no new files after April 2019, when store records show Biden dropped it off for repair.</p><p>The laptop data, as well as bank records, are at the heart of the looming Republican-led House investigation into Biden family businesses.</p><p>According to reports in other media outlets, including The Washington Post, some other versions of the laptop data circulated later appeared to have had data added after April 2019, indicating they may have been tampered with.</p><p>An attorney for Hunter Biden stated in a statement that &quot;there have been multiple attempts to hack, infect, distort, and peddle misinformation regarding Mr. Biden&apos;s devices and data.&quot; Christopher Clark, the attorney, stated that Hunter Biden&apos;s team believes, &quot;There are ongoing efforts to spread misinformation using infected and distorted data. No one ever had Mr. Biden&apos;s permission to access or share his computer data with others.&quot;</p><p>Clark&apos;s statement did not address any of the specific data, documents, or personal identification analyzed for CBS News&apos; independent review, or the findings of Computer Forensics Services. Clark also recommended Hunter Biden&apos;s recent memoir to CBS.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The laptop has yielded mountains of information about Hunter Biden&apos;s personal struggles as well as his foreign business ventures in Ukraine and with China after two years of scrutiny. There has been no direct evidence that President Biden benefited from his son&apos;s business dealings.</p><p>&quot;There is a massive amount of personal data that has been accumulated over time. Everything from photos to personal documents to photographs, as well as text messages and emails. And the sheer volume of what we&apos;re dealing with would make fabrication difficult, if not impossible &quot;Sean Lanterman, the company&apos;s incident response director, confirmed this.</p><p>Lanterman stated that the data was gathered over time in a manner &quot;consistent with normal, everyday computer use.&quot; According to the audit, that daily use of the laptop appears to have come to a halt in March 2019. That was a few weeks before the computer was brought in for repairs, which were reportedly caused by liquid damage.</p><p>The audit uncovered over 120,000 emails, 30,000 text messages, pictures, video, personal forms of identification, and voicemails from user profile data.</p><p>Mark Lanterman, chief technology officer at Computer Forensics Services, believes the data was created by Hunter Biden.</p><p>&quot;I have no doubt in my mind that this data was created by Hunter Biden, and that it came from a computer under Mr. Biden&apos;s control,&quot; he said.</p><p></span><br /></div>
