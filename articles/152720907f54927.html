				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>A man was killed and 16 people were injured after a black SUV collided with the Apple store in the Derby Street shopping center on Monday. The crash is the subject of an &quot;active criminal investigation,&quot; according to Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz.</p><p>The SUV, a Toyota 4Runner, crashed into the glass-plated storefront around 10:45 a.m. Monday and &quot;struck multiple people,&quot; Cruz said. The SUV crashed through the back wall, trapping several people inside. One person died, 14 were taken to South Shore Hospital, and two were taken to hospitals in the Boston area. A medical helicopter was also dispatched.</p><p>At 1:20 p.m., Cruz told reporters, &quot;Right now, family members are being notified or are in the process of being notified.&quot; &quot;This morning was unthinkable, and people are still processing what happened. This investigation is active and ongoing, and we have very limited information at this time.&quot;</p><p>Kevin Bradley, 65, of New Jersey, was identified as the deceased. He died while working at the store.</p><p>Apple announced on Monday afternoon that the Derby Street store would close indefinitely.</p><p>&quot;We are devastated by the shocking events at Apple Derby Street today, as well as the tragic loss of a professional who was onsite supporting recent store construction,&quot; the company said. &quot;Our hearts go out to our injured team members and customers, as well as everyone else affected by this terrible incident. We are doing everything possible to assist our team members and customers during this difficult time.&quot;</p><p>According to Steve Murphy, the Hingham fire chief, bystanders assisted the injured with first aid. 14 ambulances and seven fire engines responded, with some coming from as far away as Cohasset and Hull.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;We are unable to provide any updates on (the victims&apos;) condition at this time, but we would like to thank everyone who assisted in this situation,&quot; Murphy said.</p><p>Dr. William Tollefsen, South Shore Health&apos;s EMS and MIH Medical Director, told reporters that several victims arrived at the Weymouth hospital with life-threatening injuries. Others suffered head injuries, lower extremity injuries, and mangled limbs. An hour after the crash, police radio communications said South Shore Hospital was full and rejecting trauma patients, but hospital officials later clarified that scanner communication was inaccurate and no patients were turned away.</p><p>&quot;As soon as we could, we established an EMS command,&quot; he said. &quot;We were able to triage many critically ill patients very quickly.&quot;</p><p>Cruz stated that he had no idea how fast the SUV was traveling, but that there is an &quot;active criminal investigation.&quot; He provided no information about the driver, a male, other than the fact that he was not taken to a hospital.</p><p>Cruz stated that the crash occurred while people were walking on the sidewalk in front of the store. &quot;The Apple store is a very busy place,&quot; he explained. &quot;It&apos;s the first day of a holiday weekend. I&apos;m not sure how many people were in there. I&apos;m confident we&apos;ll find out. We&apos;ll take it slow and steady and gather information as it comes in &quot;As of 1:30 p.m. Monday, the SUV was still inside the store. Murphy stated that the building commissioner and the Plymouth County Technical Rescue Team were on the scene and had no concerns about the building&apos;s structural integrity. State Police were also called.</p><p></span><br /></div>
