				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Twenty months after DailyMail.com verified its contents with top experts, CBS has finally admitted Hunter Biden&apos;s laptop is real.</p><p>When the laptop&apos;s contents were made public ahead of the 2020 presidential election, 60 Minutes host Lesley Stahl insisted in an interview with Donald Trump that they couldn&apos;t be verified.</p><p>The network was among a slew of left-wing outlets, including the New York Times and MSNBC, that questioned the authenticity, despite the Biden administration&apos;s insistence that it was Russian disinformation.</p><p>However, two weeks after the midterm elections, CBS This Morning changed their tune.</p><p>The network aired a segment in which former Secret Service agent and computer forensics expert Mark Lanterman stated that he and his son Sean independently verified the laptop and found no evidence of outside tampering.</p><p>The story cited a voicemail from Joe Biden to his son in which he stated that he &quot;needed to get help&quot; for his ongoing drug addiction - and attributed the timing of the report to Republicans threatening to launch an investigation into the president&apos;s involvement in Hunter&apos;s foreign business deals.</p><p>DailyMail.com authenticated the laptop in March 2021, becoming the first and only news organization to publicly validate its contents through expert analysis.</p><p>Multiple outlets dismissed the scandal, social media companies ensured stories were censored, and whistleblowers claim FBI agents went out of their way to obstruct investigations. Meghan McCain, a columnist for DailyMail.com, has raised new concerns about why it has taken so long for these outlets to respond.</p><p>&apos;Anyone with five braincells could tell Hunter Biden&apos;s laptop was real,&apos; McCain said.</p><p>&apos;I&apos;m perplexed as to why CBS is celebrating or taking credit for this today - years later?&apos;</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>When asked if he believed what he saw on the laptop given to the FBI under subpoena was real and belonged to the president&apos;s scandal-plagued son, Lanterman replied, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>He went on to say that his analysis found it difficult to add any additional files, putting to rest long-held theories that foreign actors were attempting to plant information, and that drivers licenses and social security numbers found saved on the device proved it was Hunter.</p><p>&apos;After laughing off reports for two years, the mainstream media wants to celebrate their independent review&apos;s victory lap. You can&apos;t make this stuff up,&apos; tweeted Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).</p><p>In March, DailyMail.com hired Maryman  Associates, a top cyber forensics firm, to examine the hard drive to determine its authenticity.</p><p>Brad Maryman, the firm&apos;s founder, was a 29-year FBI veteran who served as Chief Information Security Officer and founded the bureau&apos;s cyber forensics unit. Dr. Joseph Greenfield, his partner, is an associate professor at the University of Southern California and helped develop their intelligence and cyber operations degree program.</p><p>Following a thorough examination of the hard drive, Greenfield and Maryman produced a report for DailyMail.com outlining their findings.</p><p>According to the report, &apos;the operating system timestamps appear to be authentic, and no evidence was found to suggest that the timestamps or data were altered or manufactured.&apos;</p><p>&apos;There were no indications that the data was manufactured.&apos;</p><p>Since then, DailyMail.com has revealed a series of troubling stories based on the scandalous material from the laptop that go to the heart of the FBI&apos;s probe into Hunter&apos;s alleged dodged taxes, foreign lobbying and suspected money laundering.</p><p></span><br /></div>
