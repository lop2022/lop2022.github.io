				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;We are devastated by the shocking events at Apple Derby Street today, as well as the tragic loss of a professional who was onsite supporting recent store construction,&quot; Apple said in a written statement. &quot;Our hearts go out to our injured team members and customers, as well as everyone else affected by this terrible incident.&quot;</p><p>The victim was identified as Kevin Bradley, 65, of New Jersey, by the District Attorney&apos;s Office.</p><p>According to South Shore Health, 17 patients were being treated for injuries ranging from head trauma to limb injuries.</p><p>&quot;We have multiple patients with life-threatening and limb-threatening injuries,&quot; said Dr. Christopher Burns, South Shore Health&apos;s chief of trauma. &quot;We have patients in the operating room and people who are scheduled to go in.&quot;</p><p>According to South Shore Health, all patients have been reunited with family members or loved ones.</p><p>&quot;We received a hilarious phone call. One minute, it&apos;s just another workday. Following that, a car crashes through the building &quot;said John Dinanno, whose daughter was injured in the crash and was taken to South Shore Hospital before being released Monday night. &quot;We&apos;re just relieved that she&apos;ll be fine. I just thank God she&apos;s okay. Just something to be thankful for as Thanksgiving approaches.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She was hit, and she claimed to have a broken bone and cuts and scrapes all over her body. She&apos;s just in a lot of pain &quot;Susan Gamble, whose niece was taken to South Shore Hospital following the crash, agreed. &quot;In fact, she went there last night and forgot her wallet, so she had to go back today, and then this happened.&quot;</p><p>Authorities said at a press conference on Monday afternoon that two more patients had been transported to hospitals in the Boston area. One was transported to Boston Medical Center, and the other to Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital.</p><p></span><br /></div>
