				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>In a report published on Monday, CBS News became the latest legacy outlet to authenticate the laptop.</p><p>It has since been verified by multiple outlets, including The New York Times, Washington Post, NBC News, and Politico, and CBS has recently joined the group.</p><p>CBS News is the latest corporate media outlet to confirm the authenticity of Hunter Biden&apos;s tainted laptop. Kevin Lamarque (Kevin Lamarque)</p><p>&quot;Hunter Biden, the president&apos;s son, will be a target for investigations as Republicans take control of the House, which means data from a laptop purportedly belonging to Biden could be crucial to the investigation. CBS News obtained its information not from a third party or political operative, but from a source who told us they gave it to the FBI under subpoena &quot;Tony Dokoupil, a CBS News anchor, stated. &quot;To determine its authenticity, we commissioned an independent forensic review.&quot;</p><p>CBS News then stated, as many other news outlets have, that there is &quot;no evidence&quot; that the laptop was faked or tampered with. CBS News claimed it wanted to &quot;cut through the noise&quot; before determining that the laptop, which contains troves of data, emails, and potentially damaging information on the president&apos;s son, is legitimate.</p><p>Republicans, according to the report, have raised concerns about Joe Biden benefiting from a 2017 email about a proposed business deal with a Chinese energy firm. According to the report, no evidence has emerged that implicates the president in any wrongdoing.</p><p>Following the report, CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King suggested that Hunter Biden should have just paid his laptop bill and saved himself a lot of trouble.</p><p>The admission about the laptop&apos;s legitimacy contrasts sharply with previous CBS News coverage of the scandalous computer.</p><p>In an interview aired just days before the 2020 election, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; veteran journalist Lesley Stahl laughed off then-President Trump&apos;s claim that Joe Biden was &quot;in the midst of a scandal.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&apos;s not,&quot; Stahl replied gleefully.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;Of course he is, Lesley,&quot; Trump stated emphatically.</p><p>&quot;No, c&apos;mon,&quot; Stahl said, dismissing the president&apos;s claim before lecturing him, &quot;This is &apos;60 Minutes,&apos; and we can&apos;t put things on that we can&apos;t verify.&quot;</p><p>Previously, CBS News dismissed Hunter Biden&apos;s laptop. (LightRocket/Erik McGregor)</p><p>She also informed Trump that the laptop &quot;could not be verified.&quot;</p><p>On the campaign trail, CBS News correspondent BoErickson was met with hostile pushback from other journalists, including one of his own colleagues, simply for inquiring about the laptop.</p><p>&quot;My @CBSEveningNewsreport clearly lays out warnings about Giuliani  Russian disinformation,&quot; then-CBS News White House correspondent Paula Reid tweeted, attempting to call Erickson&apos;s question to Biden into question.</p><p>CBS News did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Hunter Biden was also given a platform by CBS News to promote his book in 2021, with an interview that focused on his battles with addiction and efforts to make amends.</p><p>Joe Biden&apos;s son Hunter Biden speaks on Wednesday, August 20, 2020, during the fourth night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p></span><br /></div>
